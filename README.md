### ABSTRACT ###

You may ask what is a SZABO-MACHINE? or may not – anyway – I explain it to you. \ 
SZABO-MACHINE is a homage to the good old JUKEBOX. \ 
Once you put in a coin the machine will run some entertainment for a period of time - THATS'S SZABO! - only via contract on a blockchain ;)

#### CONTRACT ####

The amount of ETHER send to the contract will be transformed to a certain amount of SZABOS or BLOCKS. The contract returns the Blocknumber until its unlocked. If the blocknumber ist still above the current block.number it will just add the SZABOS on top of it.

#### SZABO ####
1 SZABO = 1 Microether or 1e12 or 1,000,000,000,000 or 0.001 Blocks
